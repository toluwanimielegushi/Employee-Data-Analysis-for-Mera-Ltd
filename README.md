## 🧩 Introduction

The aim of this project is to help Mera Ltd’s HR team uncover patterns in workforce composition, training investment, and performance. The findings are designed to guide better decision-making around resource allocation, performance management, and employee retention.

## 📘 Story of Data

The dataset contains information on:

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Before analysis:

- Cleaned empty and duplicated records
- Used Excel formulas and filters to group and transform data
- Created calculated fields such as **Salary Bands**, **Experience Levels**, and **Departmental Performance**

---

## 🔍 Pre-Analysis

Some early trends that emerged:

- More males than females across all departments
- Majority of employees fall into the 30–40 age bracket

## 🧠 In-Analysis

We dove deep using **PivotTables**, **Conditional Formatting**, and **Charts** to uncover:

- High performers tended to have higher training hours
- Finance department had the highest average salary
- Most employees had 3–6 years of experience

## 📌 Post-Analysis & Insights

**Key insights:**

- 🌟 Employees with more training scored higher performance ratings
- 💼 HR and Finance teams receive significantly higher salaries
- 🧓 Majority of employees are in mid-career stages (31–40 years)

These insights suggest a strong link between continuous training and employee output.
